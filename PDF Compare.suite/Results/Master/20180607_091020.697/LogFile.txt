2018-06-07 09:10:21.713 -0500	Log		There is a temptation at this point to try and define the set of common functions that will be needed and\npre-implement these functions before testers start working on implementing scripts for test cases. We\nrecommend not doing this; our experience shows that many of the functions implemented are never used,\nmany of the functions that are used have to be significantly refactored to be used effectively from scripts\nimplementing test cases, and there is a demotivational effect of putting in a lot of scripting effort and not\nhaving any automated test cases to show for it. Instead, we recommend that a clear approach to\nmodularization is defined upfront and then this repository is built up as needed, e.g., the first person to\nimplement a test script for a test case that requires a login step should realize that this is likely to be a\ncommon function and add their implementation to the repository.\n3.3 Set up your relationships with other teams.\nA test team does not work in isolation. They work with the development team to get new versions of the	7	on_master	Master.script
