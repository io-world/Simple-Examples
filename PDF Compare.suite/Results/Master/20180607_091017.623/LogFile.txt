Preparation tasks\nThis section lists a set of critical preparation tasks that should be included in your project plan.\n3.1 Set up your test environment.\nAn inadequate test environment is possibly the most common cause of wasted time and unreliable test\nresults. It is essential that you design and set up a reliable test environment before you start significant test\nscript creation and execution. Note that setting up a reliable test environment is not difficult if planned and\nresourced properly, but if it is done in an ad hoc manner, it usually causes problems.\nYou should consider the following when setting up your test environment:\n•\tEnsure all the necessary test systems are included in the environment. If you are testing mobile,\nthere are many references available on the Internet to help you define a representative set of\ndevices for your target audience.\n•\tEnsure there are enoueh test svstems so that no one is ever waiting. Consider manual testers.	7	on_master	Master.script
