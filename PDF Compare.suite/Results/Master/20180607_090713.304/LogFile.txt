2018-06-07 09:07:14.555 -0500	Log		The following project management elements are essential:\n•\tA project manager. A project manager with sufficient time to dedicate to the project, an under¬\nstanding of test automation, an understanding of the product being tested, and enough technical\nknowledge to understand test environment issues.\n•\tObjectives. Clearly defined outcome and output objectives (see below).\n•\tA project plan. A clear and maintained project plan. Section 3 defines a set of standard preparation\ntasks that should be included in the project plan and Section 4 defines the standard, ongoing activi¬\nties that should be included in the project plan.\n•\tRegular reviews. Regular and frequent project reviews.\n2.1 Project objectives\nWhat do you want to accomplish with test automation? This sounds like a simple question, but is often\ndifficult to quantify, yet is critical to a successful project.\nTest automation projects should have both output objectives and outcome objectives. Output objectives are\nthe tangible outputs and activities of the project, e.g., a set of automated test scripts for a product's smoke\ntests. Outcome objectives are the value that these outputs will provide, e.g., a reduction of a test cycle from\none week to two days. Output objectives are key to keeping a project focused and ensuring delivery;\noutcome objectives are key to ensuring the project delivers value to the team.\nThe following list presents best practices for defining project objectives:\n•\tTest objectives should cover both business and technical requirements. Business requirements tend\nto be outcome objectives (e.g., improve time to market by 20 percent) and technical requirements\ntend to be output objectives (e.g., automate the smoke-test suite), but this is not always the case.
